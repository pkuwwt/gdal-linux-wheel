# GDAL Python Bindings Via *manylinux* Wheels

This project is based on [youngpm/gdalmanylinux](https://github.com/youngpm/gdalmanylinux) and [gdal-wheels-for-linux](https://git.code.sf.net/p/gdal-wheels-for-linux/v3.1.4) but provides precompiled GDAL wheels ready to use in both Python and C/C++ projects (Linux only)

## Download precompiled wheels

`python3 -m pip install /path/to/wheel.whl`
